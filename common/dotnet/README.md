# .NET workers

From the repository root, run `python -m bench.build --dotnet`.
The bootstrap supports Linux x64/arm64 and installs SDK 10.0.401 and runtime
10.0.12 locally. OPC Foundation UA-.NETStandard 1.5.378.176 is pinned as a public
submodule. SDK archives and package versions are pinned in `toolchain.json`
and `locks/`; builds use Release configuration.

The SDK, NuGet cache, and CLI state stay under ignored `deps/` directories.
Linux requires the usual .NET native libraries, including OpenSSL, ICU, zlib,
libstdc++, and Kerberos. Sampling never restores packages or downloads tools.

Select `ua-dotnet` in server suites or `client:server` throughput pairs after
building. Worker preflight checks source, dependency, and artifact fingerprints;
rerun the build after changing them. Saved runs require compatible provenance
when amended.

Encrypted throughput uses Basic256Sha256 SignAndEncrypt, explicit peer trust,
and certificate URI/domain validation. The throughput profile allows 64 MiB
messages and arrays through 4k; server-limit profiles retain SDK defaults.
Managed heap limits reserve 25% of the worker memory share for native/runtime
use and do not guarantee a total RSS bound. JIT and GC use runtime defaults.

The throughput runner sizes `MaxQueuedRequestCount` to at least the largest
selected aggregate pipeline (clients × outstanding requests per client), with
a minimum of the SDK default of 200. This prevents queue admission failures
under the configured load. The effective limit is recorded in
`ua_dotnet_diagnostics.max_queued_request_count`. The `server_limits` profile
keeps the SDK default; these throughput results describe the configured server.
